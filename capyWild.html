    <p class="paragraph">
        In the wild, capybaras live in large groups of up to 20 individuals, although larger groups have been observed.
        They are social animals and often share their habitat with other species, such as birds and turtles. </p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Capybaras are herbivorous and feed on a variety of plants and grasses, including aquatic
        vegetation.
        They spend much of their time in or near water and are excellent swimmers, using their webbed feet to navigate
        and dive underwater. </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Capybaras are crepuscular animals, which means that they are most active during dawn and dusk.
        During the day, they rest in burrows or in the shade of trees, emerging in the late afternoon to forage for
        food.
        Capybaras are preyed upon by a variety of predators, including jaguars, pumas, and anacondas.
        To avoid predators, they rely on their excellent sense of smell and hearing and their ability to move quickly
        and gracefully in and out of water. </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Capybaras are well-adapted to their semi-aquatic habitat and lead an active and social lifestyle in the wild.
