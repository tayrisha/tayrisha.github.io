            Capybaras are large, semi-aquatic rodents native to South America. They are the largest rodents in the world, with adults weighing anywhere from 35 to 66 kilograms and reaching up to 1.3 meters in length. 
            Capybaras have a round, stout body, short legs, and a blunt nose with small ears and eyes.

        <p class = "paragraph">
            They are social animals that live in groups of up to 20 individuals, although larger groups have been observed. 
            They are herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plants and grasses, and spend much of their time in or near water. 
            In fact, they are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for up to five minutes underwater.

        <p class = "paragraph">
            Capybaras are often hunted for their meat and fur, and their populations are threatened in some areas due to habitat loss and hunting. 
            However, they are also kept as pets in some parts of the world, although this practice is controversial due to the unique care requirements and potential health risks associated with keeping such a large, exotic animal as a pet.
